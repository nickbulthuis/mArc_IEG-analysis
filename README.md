# mArc_IEG-analysis
Analysis of Arc+ and c-fos+ hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) ensembles in single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data, published in "A multiple Arc (mArc) tagging system to uncover the organizational principles of multiple memories" by Stackmann, et. al.

Included here are 1) an R Markdown file containing the scripts used for analysis, along with 2) a knitted HTML render of that same Markdown file, for easier viewing and visualization of figures.

These analyses have been conducted by Nicholas E. Bulthuis in the Christine Ann Denny Lab at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) and the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI) in 2025.
